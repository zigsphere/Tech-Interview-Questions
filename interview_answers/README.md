19. Say that I opened my browser and went to www.google.com. Describe what exactly happens in order for the page to display in my browser?

Your browser initiates a DNS lookup to find the IP address of www.google.com then sends an HTTP request to Google's server. The server then responds with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of the page. Your browser then renders the page content, making additional requests for objects like images and executing JavaScript code.

20. What is an inode? What metadata does it contain?

An inode is a data structure on a filesystem on Unix-like systems. It stores information about a filesystem object but does not contain the data itself or the filename. Metadata in an inode includes the file size, device ID, user ID, group ID, file mode, timestamps, and link count.

21. What is the difference between a hard link and a soft link (symlink)?

A hard link is a direct reference to the file's inode, acting indistinguishably from the file itself. A symlink is a pointer to a file name; it's a separate file that redirects to another file or directory.

22. What is the Windows registry? How does linux do the same thing? Mac?

The Windows Registry is a database storing low-level settings for the OS and applications. Linux uses configuration files (often found in /etc) and directories for this purpose. macOS utilizes both configuration files and a database similar to the Registry called plist files.

23. What is the bootup process of a machine of your choice?

For a Linux machine, the boot process typically involves the BIOS/UEFI initializing hardware, then booting from a storage device. It loads the bootloader (like GRUB) which then loads the kernel. The kernel initializes the system and starts the init process, which brings up the system in user-space.

24. What are the differences between 802.11 a, b, g, and n?

'a' uses 5GHz (faster speeds, shorter range), 'b' and 'g' use 2.4GHz ('b' is slower, 'g' is faster), and 'n' can use both frequencies.

25. What is in an IP header? TCP Header?

An IP header includes source and destination addresses and other data for routing. A TCP header includes ports, sequence numbers, and flags for data management.

26. What is the difference between a public IP and a private IP?

33. How are ICMP packets denoted in the IP header? How are ICMP echo and reply denoted?

ICMP packets are identified by the protocol field in the IP header. Echo requests and replies are differentiated by their type and code fields.

34. What routing protocol do you think Google uses and why?

Google likely uses advanced routing protocols that can handle large amounts of data efficiently, such as BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). BGP helps manage how packets of data are routed across the internet, choosing the best paths for data to travel quickly and reliably, which is crucial for a massive network like Google's.

35. You have 2 Linux machines. How would you copy host A's disk0 to host B's disk1 and verify it copied correctly?

You can use the dd command to copy the entire disk from host A to host B over a network connection, then use ssh for the transfer. To verify it copied correctly, you can compare checksums of both disks using a command like md5sum or sha256sum. This ensures both disks have the exact same data.

36. A user with a Windows laptop says that whenever they try to visit a particular website they instead see some strange Russian website they're not expecting. How would you troubleshoot this?

First, check the browser's settings and extensions to ensure nothing is redirecting the user. Then, inspect the system for malware or viruses that could cause redirects. Finally, check the hosts file for any unusual entries that might redirect websites.

37. In Linux, you want to unmount a filesystem but it is in use. Can you fix this without rebooting the machine?

Yes, you can use the lsof or fuser commands to find out what processes are using the filesystem. Then, you can safely stop those processes or services. After stopping them, you should be able to unmount the filesystem without rebooting.

38. What is RAID? Describe RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10

    RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. It's a way to store the same data in different places on multiple hard disks to protect data in the case of a drive failure.
        RAID 0 splits data evenly across two or more disks with no redundancy, offering improved performance but no fault tolerance.
        RAID 1 mirrors data across two or more disks, providing high fault tolerance.
        RAID 5 distributes data and parity information across three or more disks, offering a good balance of performance, storage capacity, and fault tolerance.
        RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but can withstand two disks failing simultaneously thanks to extra parity data.
        RAID 10 combines mirroring and striping to provide both high performance and fault tolerance by using at least four disks.

39-40. Your machine needs to send data to a host with an IP address on the same LAN. How does it specify the address the data should go to? Be prepared to talk about any acronyms you mention.

    It uses the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to find out the MAC (Media Access Control) address that corresponds to the IP address in the same LAN. The data is then sent to that specific MAC address.

It's useful because it helps protect the integrity of the data by allowing the system to recover more quickly and accurately in case of a power failure or system crash by replaying or ignoring uncommitted changes.

45. What is HTTPS? How does it work?

    HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It's the secure version of HTTP, where communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. This is achieved through the use of SSL/TLS protocols, which ensure that any data transferred cannot be intercepted or read by others.

46. How do private and public keys work?

    Private and public keys are part of encryption systems, like RSA, used for secure communication. The public key can be shared with anyone and is used to encrypt messages. The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt messages encrypted with the public key. This ensures that only the holder of the private key can read the message.

47. Does DNS use TCP or UDP? Why?

    DNS (Domain Name System) primarily uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for its queries due to the protocol's speed and efficiency with small amounts of data. However, it can use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for larger queries or zone transfers, which require reliability and error-checking.

48. What is QoS?

    QoS stands for Quality of Service. It's a technology that manages data traffic to reduce packet loss, latency and jitter on a network. QoS prioritizes certain types of traffic (like video conferencing) over less critical traffic (like file downloads), ensuring that important applications have the bandwidth they need to perform well.

49. What is a VLAN?

52. What is a fork bomb?

    A fork bomb is a type of attack against a system that involves creating a large number of processes very quickly to saturate the available space in the list of processes, causing the system to slow down or crash due to resource exhaustion.

53. How would you test if a port is open on a remote server?

    You can use tools like telnet, nc (netcat), or nmap to test if a port is open on a remote server. These tools allow you to attempt a connection to the specified port on the server. If the connection is successful, the port is open.

54. You opened a port on a server, but from the outside, you cannot connect to that port. What might the problem be?

    The issue could be due to a firewall blocking the port on the server or along the network path. Another possibility is that the service meant to listen on that port isn't running or is configured incorrectly. Also, network configuration issues like incorrect routing or IP address settings could prevent access.

55. A fellow technician says that a Windows machine they're working on has an IP address of 169.254.101.6, and asks you to help him troubleshoot. What do you do?

    An IP address starting with 169.254 indicates that the machine is using Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) because it couldn't obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. Check the network connection, ensure the DHCP server is operational, and try renewing the IP address on the Windows machine using the ipconfig /renew command.

56. What are IPTables? What are the different things you can do with them?

    IPTables is a command-line firewall utility in Linux that allows you to define rules for how incoming and outgoing traffic should be handled. With IPTables, you can filter traffic, redirect traffic, allow or block specific ports or IP addresses, and protect the system from unauthorized access.

57. On a Linux machine, how can you spin up a webserver? What is a vhost? Where do the configuration files live?

    To spin up a webserver on Linux, you can install web server software like Apache or Nginx using package managers (apt for Debian/Ubuntu, yum for CentOS). A virtual host (vhost) allows a single web server to serve multiple websites. Configuration files for Apache typically live in /etc/apache2/sites-available on Debian/Ubuntu systems and /etc/httpd/conf.d on CentOS systems. For Nginx, they're usually in /etc/nginx/sites-available.

72. What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?

    git fetch downloads changes from a remote repository to your local repo without merging them, while git pull fetches changes and then automatically merges them into your current branch.

73. What does git rebase do?

    git rebase is used to apply changes from one branch onto another, effectively moving the base of the current branch to the tip of another branch. This is often used to maintain a clean project history by integrating changes without creating merge commits.

74. Write a Puppet class to include the apache module and add the attributes for hostname and www_root. Set www_root to /mnt/mount.

puppet

class webserver {
  class { 'apache':
    www_root => '/mnt/mount',
    # Assuming hostname is managed via a different parameter or fact.
  }
}

75. The node that has /mnt/root begins having issues. The /mnt/root is an NFS mount and a process is using the mount. What commands can you use to determine what is using the mount?

    Use lsof | grep /mnt/root or fuser -m /mnt/root to identify processes using the mount.

76. Let's say you have 5 web hosts behind HAproxy. One of the servers started experiencing issues. What would you do?

    Initially, I would temporarily remove or disable the problematic server in the HAproxy configuration to mitigate impact on the service. Then, I'd investigate logs and system metrics on the affected server to diagnose the issue.

77. From the last question, how would you troubleshoot the node having issues?

    Check server logs (access logs, error logs), system health (CPU, memory, disk usage), and application-specific metrics. Use tools like top, netstat, and application performance monitoring (APM) solutions for deeper insights.

78. You have a border router and behind the router is an HAproxy endpoint serving 5 web nodes behind it. All of a sudden, you begin getting 10Gbps traffic to the HAproxy node and it becomes unresponsive. What do you do?

    Implement rate limiting or DDoS protection rules on the border router or use external DDoS mitigation services. You might also redistribute traffic, if possible, and analyze the traffic pattern to block malicious sources.

79. What is a Puppet module? If you needed to make changes to a module, what can you do?

    A Puppet module is a collection of manifests and data (such as files, templates, and facts) defining a specific configuration to manage resources. To modify a module, you can edit its manifests or data files directly, or override its parameters in your node or class definitions.

80. What are ports and port numbers to DNS, FTP, and DHCP?

    DNS: 53 (TCP/UDP), FTP: 21 for command/control (TCP), 20 for data transfer (TCP), DHCP: 67 for server and 68 for client (UDP).
